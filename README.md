# Hospital Management System 
This is a Simple c++ Standalone Application wcreated for SCS2104 - Programming III module.

## Scenario:

A Hospital consists of a number of specialized wards (such as Maternity, Pediatrics, Oncology, Gynecologist etc.). 
Each ward has a number of patients, who are admitted on the recommendation of external physicians (may be their family doctors) and confirmed by a consultant employed by the Hospital. 
On admission, the personal details of every patient are recorded. 
A separate register is to be held to store information of tests undertaken and results of a prescribed treatment. 
A number of tests may be conducted for each patient. 
Each patient is assigned to one leading consultant, but may be examined by another doctor, if required.
Doctors are specialists in some branch of medicine and may be leading consultants for a number of patients, not necessarily from the same ward. 
Payment details of each patient needs to be recorded separately. 
The hospital management requires to maintain the details of the employees of the hospital (Doctors, Nurses, Maintenance staff etc.) 
The attendance of the employees needs to be recorded in order to process their salaries. 

Implement a stand-alone application for the above scenario The system must be implemented based on the object orientation concepts and database connectivity in c++.
You may design user interfaces according to your solution.
